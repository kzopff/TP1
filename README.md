Machine learning models can be used to predict binary outcomes for datasets in various fields of study. In this report, a decision tree model was used with a large dataset on Patient Survival after one year of treatment at a hospital in Greenland.  Certain variables describe each patient, such as whether or not the patient was a smoker, whether the patient was from a rural or urban area, and which drug the patient was treated with. Additionally, the main characteristics we used in the model were the patient’s age, the patient’s body mass index, and the number of previous conditions displayed in the patient (ranging from 1 to 5). These variables were then used with a decision tree machine learning model to predict if the patient survived one year or not.
